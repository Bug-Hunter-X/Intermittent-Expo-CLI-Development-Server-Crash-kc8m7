While using Expo CLI, I encountered a peculiar issue where the development server would randomly crash without any clear error message in the terminal. This would happen intermittently, making debugging and development very frustrating.  The project would build successfully, but the Metro bundler would terminate unexpectedly, often after a period of seemingly normal operation.  No specific actions seemed to consistently trigger the crash.  It happened with both iOS and Android simulators and physical devices.
